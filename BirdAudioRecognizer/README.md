# BirdAudioRecognizer

In this project I tried to play around a bit with some deep learning models, to find what worked best to analyze audio.
I knew there were much bigger models out there (for example BirdNet) that already work fantastically well,
but the main intent of this project was to try to reverse engineer to some extent the way in which these models operate.
Eventually I made it work, however since I don't have multiple GPUs to run it became infeasible to classify
the birds, once I tried to scale up the training data. I did however have a lot of fun researching what helps to better recognize audio
with classification models.
